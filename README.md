# @danguita's dotfiles

These are some of the dotfiles I need everyday. Note that each depends on a library or a specific software:

### Vim
`.vimrc.after`, `.vimrc.before`, `.gvimrc.after`

These are not regular Vim files, they depend on [Janus Vim distribution](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus), which provides a master `.vimrc` file and tons of auto-managed plugins.

### Zsh
`.zshrc`

I use [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) as my default shell. This config file is pretty brief because [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) manages most of the config and plugins.

### GNU screen & tmux
`.screenrc`, `.tmux.conf`

There's nothing to say, these are the most well-known terminal multiplexers. For now my choice is GNU screen.

### Other files
* `.rvmrc` defines [Ruby Version Manager](http://beginrescueend.com/) path
* `.gitignore` sets the default ignored files in a git repo

For config files?! Feel free to use any of them.
